What is dingo about?

**WARNING** Note, currently the data source Dingo relies on - the
[Open Energy Database](http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/dataedit/) - has no public
accessible API, yet. Thus, currently you won't be able to run Dingo without
modifications.

DIstribution Network GeneratOr (Dingo) is a tool to generate synthetic medium
and low voltage power distribution grids based on open (or at least accessible)
data.
This software project is part of the research project
`open_eGo <https://openegoproject.wordpress.com>`_.

The theoretical background is detailed in section :ref:`theoretical_background`.
Install the software package as explained :ref:`installation`. Take up on the
:ref:`dingo-examples` to understand how to use the software.
