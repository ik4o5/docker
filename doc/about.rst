## Generating LV-Grids

### Introduction/Litrature
Informations on LV-Grids in Germany can be found on several sources:
* [Kerber](http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/literature/entry/17/) discribes 8 rual and 3 village and 8 suburban LV Grids; each with several branch lines. The exampelary grids are based on 132 real MV/LV Substations data in south Germany.
* [Scheffler] (http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/literature/entry/18/) gives statistical data about technical parameters of LV grids dividet on 8 types of settlement areas.
* [Mohrmann] (http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/literature/entry/19/) discribes statistical data about technical parameters of LV grids based on 2700 LV-Grids.
* Demirel
However, a method to gernerate a representative variation of LV-grids, that can be assinged to the modeled LV/MV substations can not be found.
Given data on MV/LV substations: 
* landuse data devided in industry, comrecial, agriculture and residatial
* population
* --> peak load
