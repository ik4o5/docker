Release v0.1.11 month day, year
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Changes
-------

* Assignment of loads to generators in lv_connect_generators
  was made deterministic. Before this happened randomly leading
  to different lv_grids using the same input data. The network
  creation is now reproducible while lv_branches were reinforced
  differently before. 
  
  Should solve 
  `#245 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/245>`_
  and at least parts of 
  `#40 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/40>`_.
* A proper sign convention (see :ref:`sign-convention-pq`) for P,Q is introduced
  `#266 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/266>`_,
  see also `PR #271 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/pull/271>`_.
  
* Equipment table data is cleaned sothat only necessary literature values are used.

  Should solve 
  `#296 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/issues/296>`_

* Tests for debugging are introduced. Can be used to check whether electrical data has changed or not.

* Various bugfixes that come with this PR.

* Reproducible labels.
