Based on code by oemof development team

This module provides a highlevel layer for reading and writing config files.
There must be a file called "config.ini" in the root-folder of the project.
The file has to be of the following structure to be imported correctly.
# this is a comment \n
# the filestructure is like: \n
 \n
[netCDF] \n
RootFolder = c://netCDF \n
FilePrefix = cd2_ \n
 \n
[mySQL] \n
host = localhost \n
user = guest \n
password = root \n
database = znes \n
 \n
[SectionName] \n
OptionName = value \n
Option2 = value2 \n
