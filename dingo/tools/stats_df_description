NOTES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on generation capacity: 		Total MV gen cap = sum_{<level>} Gen. Cap. of MV at v_level <level> 
							 = sum_{<type>/<sub_type>} Gen. Cap. of MV <type>/<sub_type> 
				
					LA Total LV Gen. Cap. = sum_{<level>} Gen. Cap. of LV at v_level <level> 

					Total Gen Cap = Total MV gen cap + LA Total LV Gen. Cap. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on peak load: 			Total MV peak load = 0
					Total LV peak load = LA Total LV Peak Load Agricultural + LA Total LV Peak Load Industrial + LA Total LV Peak Load Residential + LA Total LV Peak Load Retail 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on branches length:		Total MV lenght = Length of MV Non-Rings total + Length of MV Rings total 
							= Length of MV overhead lines + Length of MV underground cable
							= sum_{<type>} Length of MV type <type>

					Total LV lenght = Length of LV overhead lines + Length of LV underground cable
							= sum_{<type>} Length of LV type <type>

					Total Length 	= Total MV lenght + Total LV lenght
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on units:				Generation Capacities and Peak Loads are assummed to be all in kW. But this is not checked.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on Rings:				Rings are either:
					1) a closed path between MV station to itself through a closed circuit breaker, or
					2) a branch between the MV station and an Aggregated Load Area
					The Gen Capacity of a Ring, is the generation capacity of all generators which are part of the ring. Not of the generators that are connected to a ring through a cable distributor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on missing things:			Nominal value of voltages, voltages deviation, and related stats are not yet implemented
					Branches capacity violations are not yet implemented
					For this two aspects it is probably better to generate another dataframe with all the branches and nodes in a network, otherwise it is a bit pointless.
